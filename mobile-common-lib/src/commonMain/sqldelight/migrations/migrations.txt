1. Create a new migration file under sqldelight/migrations directory. Also update
   related .sq files to match new DB structure.
2. Check that migration works by running gradle task 'verifyCommonMainRiistaDatabaseMigration'
3. Run gradle task 'generateCommonMainRiistaDatabaseSchema'. This will create a .db
   file containing the current schema. Add that file to the version control.
